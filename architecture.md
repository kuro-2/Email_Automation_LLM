# AI Communication Assistant - Detailed Architecture

## Component Breakdown

### 1. Email Processing Service
```python
# Responsibilities:
- Multi-provider email fetching (Gmail, Outlook, IMAP)
- Email parsing and metadata extraction
- Deduplication logic
- Rate limiting and API quota management
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
```

### 2. AI Classification Service  
```python
# Responsibilities:
- Sentiment analysis using RoBERTa model
- Urgency classification with configurable rules
- Category detection (Support, Sales, Complaint, etc.)
- Confidence scoring and uncertainty handling
- Batch processing for efficiency
```

### 3. RAG Response Generation Service
```python
# Responsibilities:
- Context retrieval from vector store
- Prompt engineering for Llama 3 8B
- Response generation with safety checks
- Template-based personalization
- Quality scoring and filtering
```

### 4. Priority Queue Management
```python
# Responsibilities:
- Redis-based priority queue implementation
- Dynamic priority calculation
- SLA tracking and escalation
- Load balancing across workers
- Dead letter queue handling
```

### 5. Data Management Layer
```sql
-- Core Tables:
- emails: Email records with metadata
- classifications: AI-generated insights
- responses: Draft responses and history
- users: User profiles and permissions
- audit_logs: System activity tracking
- knowledge_base: RAG training data
```

## Data Flow Architecture

1. **Email Ingestion**: Scheduled jobs fetch emails from providers
2. **Processing Pipeline**: Emails enter Redis queue for AI processing  
3. **Classification**: AI models analyze sentiment, urgency, and categories
4. **Response Generation**: RAG system generates contextual draft responses
5. **Dashboard Updates**: WebSocket notifications update frontend in real-time
6. **User Review**: Support agents review and modify AI-generated responses
7. **Analytics**: System tracks metrics and generates insights

## Security & Privacy Design

- **PII Redaction**: Automatic detection and masking of sensitive data
- **Token Security**: Encrypted storage of API tokens and credentials  
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions with Supabase RLS
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all system actions
- **Data Encryption**: At-rest and in-transit encryption

## Performance & Scalability

- **Async Processing**: FastAPI with async/await for non-blocking operations
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis for frequently accessed data
- **Database Optimization**: Proper indexing and query optimization
- **Load Balancing**: Horizontal scaling of AI processing workers
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and performance metrics

This architecture ensures a robust, scalable, and secure communication assistant that can handle enterprise-level email processing while maintaining user privacy and system reliability.
